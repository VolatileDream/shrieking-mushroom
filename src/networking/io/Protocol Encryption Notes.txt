Encryption Notes : 

	Encrypting the protocol stream works as follows:
	
	Setup and initial connection
		-Verification of program versions and compatibilities ( currently no backwards compatibility provided )
		-Sharing of asymmetric public keys
			-check if they are authorized
		-Switch to asymmetric encryption
			-Challenge Response?
			-Sharing of symmetric key
		-Switch to symmetric encryption 
			-Stream data


	Possibility of using Cipher[In/out]putStream and creating a new one after flushing the underlying stream?
